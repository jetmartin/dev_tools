# Tips

## Get currnt linux distribution

```sh
uname -a
```

Open a terminal program (get to a command prompt) and type uname -a. This will give you your kernel version, but might not mention the distribution your 
running. To find out what distribution of linux your running (Ex. Ubuntu) try lsb_release -a or cat /etc/*release or cat /etc/issue* or cat /proc/version.

## Get location of a cmd binary

```sh
which bash
```

## Get current user

```sh
whoami
```
